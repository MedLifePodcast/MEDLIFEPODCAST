## Welcome To All Aspiring Doctors

This is the website for Med Life Podcast, a podcast about getting into and succeeding in medical school. I have enjoyed cronicaling my journey and hopefully helping some people out along the way. Join me through the entire process, applying, acceptance, medical school, and more as I post short podcasts with tips and tricks I have learned in my journey to become a doctor. Keep an eye out for season 2, where I talk about medical school as an actual DO student starting this August.
